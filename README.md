🪣 Buck-It
Dream it. Do it. Remember it.

Buck-It is a social bucket list app where people don’t just plan goals — they share experiences, save memories, and track their journey together.

Built for individuals and groups, Buck-It turns bucket lists into living stories filled with photos, moments, and progress — not forgotten notes.
